# Research Applications

DiArMaqAr provides unprecedented tools for systematic investigation of maqāmic relationships while maintaining connection to conventional frameworks. This guide outlines key research applications and use cases.

## Comparative Tuning System Analysis

The platform's integration of historical tuning systems enables comparative analysis of Arabic theoretical frameworks through consistent Arab-Ottoman-Persian note naming.

### Research Questions

- How does the same maqām manifest across different temperaments?
- What are the consistencies and variations in theoretical approaches?
- How do historical tuning systems compare to modern frameworks?
- What are the practical implications of theoretical choices?

### Methodology

1. Select a maqām (e.g., Maqām Rāst)
2. Compare across multiple tuning systems:
   - Al-Kindī (9th century ratios)
   - Al-Fārābī (10th century tunings)
   - Ibn Sīnā (11th century approaches)
   - Al-Ṣabbāgh (20th century comma-based system)
3. Analyze:
   - Pitch class values
   - Interval relationships
   - Available transpositions
   - Modulation possibilities

### Example: Theoretical Evolution

Comparing Al-Fārābī's 10th-century ratios with Al-Ṣabbāgh's 20th-century comma-based system demonstrates:
- Theoretical evolution over time
- Maintenance of essential intervallic relationships
- Impact of measurement approaches on modal availability

## Starting Note Convention Analysis

A crucial analytical capability lies in systematic comparison of tuning systems based on different starting note conventions.

### Research Framework

**Oud-Based Systems (ʿushayrān):**
- Reflect oud tuning in perfect fourths
- Instrument-specific approaches
- Examples: Al-Kindī, Al-Fārābī (oud conventions)

**Monochord/Sonometer Systems (yegāh/rāst):**
- Abstract theoretical measurement
- Cairo Congress (1932) approaches
- Examples: Modern theoretical frameworks

### Research Applications

1. **Availability Analysis:**
   - Compare number of available maqāmāt
   - Compare number of available ajnās
   - Analyze transposition possibilities

2. **Modulation Networks:**
   - Compare modulation capabilities
   - Identify differences in pathway structures
   - Analyze theoretical accessibility

3. **Historical Instrument Practice:**
   - Understand how instrumental traditions affect theory
   - Reveal connections between practice and theory
   - Examine theoretical evolution

## Quantitative Analysis

The platform's analytics capabilities provide quantitative insights into maqāmic relationships.

### Dataset Generation

Export comprehensive datasets for:
- All maqāmāt in selected tuning systems
- All possible transpositions
- Complete modulation networks
- Ajnās compatibility matrices

### Statistical Analysis

**Correlation Studies:**
- Relationship between tuning system characteristics and transposition possibilities
- Correlation between transposition availability and modulation networks
- Impact of starting note conventions on modal accessibility

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Systematic modulation structures
- Transposition frequency patterns
- Ajnās distribution analysis

### Example Research

Analyze relationships between:
- Number of pitch classes and available maqāmāt
- Starting note convention and transposition possibilities
- Tuning system complexity and modulation network density

## Musicological Research

The platform enables systematic analysis of traditional repertoire that would be extremely laborious through manual methods.

### Arabic Composition Practice

**Historical Analysis:**
- Compare modulation pathways in compositions for Um Kulthūm by:
  - Muḥammad ʿAbd al-Wahhāb
  - Riyāḍ Al-Ṣunbāṭī
  - Balīgh Ḥamdī
- Reveal compositional patterns beyond documented frameworks
- Identify innovations in modulation practice

### Maqām Naming and Classification

**Theoretical Investigation:**
- Analyze comma-based systems (Al-Ṣabbāgh)
- Understand relationship between transposition and naming
- Examine why same pitch classes with different transpositions receive different names
- Example: Maqām ḥijāz vs. Maqām shad ʿarabān

### Arabic Music Pedagogy

**Tuning and Intonation Analysis:**
- Address contradictory discussions (e.g., Faraj and Shumays 2019)
- Provide reference to specific Arabic tuning systems
- Support nuanced discussions beyond binary debates
- Enable analysis beyond assertions of "arbitrariness"
