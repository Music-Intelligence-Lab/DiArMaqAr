## What is DiArMaqAr?

The Digital Arabic Maqām Archive (DiArMaqAr) is an open-source, bilingual browser-based application and repository designed for musicians, composers, developers, and scholars engaged with Arabic maqām theory.

The application integrates an archive of historically documented **tanāghīm** (tuning systems), **ajnās** (tetrachords), **maqāmāt** (melodic modes), **suyūr** (melodic performance pathways), and **intiqālāt** (modulation practices) within a unified digital framework, establishing verified reference data for education, performance, composition, software development, machine learning applications, and instrument design.

### Cultural Framework

The implementation operates entirely within **Arabic theoretical frameworks** and epistemological systems. All operations are grounded in the historical Arab-Ottoman-Persian note naming convention, with tuning-system-sensitive transposition capabilities that maintain intervallic integrity. This culture-specific methodology follows decolonial computing principles, avoiding Western-centric paradigms in digital musicology.

## Key Features
