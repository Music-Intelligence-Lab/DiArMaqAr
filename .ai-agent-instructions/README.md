## How to Use These Files

### For General Development Tasks

1. Read **`00-ai-agent-personality.md`** first (if first time)
   - **Note**: Includes important guidance on using MCP servers (Context7, Playwright)
2. Skim **`01-project-overview.md`** to understand the project
3. Reference **`02-architecture.md`** and **`03-development-conventions.md`** as needed
   - **Note**: `03-development-conventions.md` has MCP usage guidelines
4. Consult **`04-musicological-principles.md`** when working with music theory logic

### For Testing Tasks

1. Use **`05-testing-guide.md`** for comprehensive testing protocols
2. Consider using **Playwright MCP** for automated browser testing
3. Reference **`04-musicological-principles.md`** to understand expected behaviors

### For Documentation Tasks

1. Follow **`06-documentation-standards.md`** for all documentation
2. Use **Context7 MCP** to fetch current library documentation when needed
3. Reference **`00-ai-agent-personality.md`** for cultural sensitivity guidelines

### For Bug Fixes

1. Check **`04-musicological-principles.md`** for common pitfalls
2. Use **`05-testing-guide.md`** debugging protocols
3. Reference **`02-architecture.md`** to understand data flow

## File Organization Principles

### Numbered Prefixes

Files are numbered to suggest a reading order:
- **00**: Universal principles (any project)
- **01**: Project introduction
- **02-03**: Technical implementation
- **04**: Domain-specific knowledge (music theory)
- **05-06**: Quality assurance (testing, documentation)

### Separation of Concerns

- **Architecture** (02) vs **Conventions** (03): Structure vs style
- **Principles** (04) vs **Testing** (05): Theory vs practice
- **Universal** (00) vs **Project-specific** (01-06): Reusable vs contextual

---

## Maintenance Guidelines

### When to Update These Files

**Update immediately when:**
- Discovering new musicological insights during debugging
- Establishing new architectural patterns
- Identifying common pitfalls or best practices
- Changing core conventions or standards

**Update during quarterly reviews:**
- Verify all examples still match current codebase
- Check links and cross-references
- Update testing scenarios based on new features
- Refresh documentation based on evolved patterns

### Knowledge Preservation Protocol

After completing tasks successfully:
1. Review work for unique insights
2. Document findings in appropriate file(s)
3. Include specific examples from implementation
4. Explain implications for future development

## Version Control

This folder (`.ai-agent-instructions/`) is added to `.gitignore` to allow local customization without affecting the repository. However, the contents should be preserved and shared when:

- Setting up new development environments
- Onboarding new AI assistants
- Archiving project knowledge
- Creating project documentation

---

## Philosophy

These instructions embody:

1. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Decolonial computing principles applied practically
2. **Knowledge Preservation**: Insights from debugging become lasting wisdom
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, dig deeper as needed
4. **Practical Focus**: Real examples, real code, real scenarios
5. **Living Documentation**: Updated continuously as project evolves
