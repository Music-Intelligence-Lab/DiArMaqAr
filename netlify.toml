# Netlify configuration for Next.js deployment
# This ensures API routes are handled as serverless functions with proper query parameter support
# Build docs first (generates openapi.json and VitePress static files), then build Next.js

  publish = ".next"

# Use Netlify's Next.js plugin for proper serverless function handling

# Note: Static files from public/docs/ should be served by Next.js automatically
# The route handler at /docs/[[...slug]] will handle HTML pages, but static
# assets like .json, .js, .css should be served directly by Netlify
