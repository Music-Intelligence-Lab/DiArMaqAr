# Arabic Maqām Network

A comprehensive web-based application for the interactive exploration of Arabic maqām theory through computational modeling and visualization. The platform integrates historical tanāghīm (tuning systems), ajnās (tetrachords), maqāmāt (melodic modes), suyūr (melodic performance pathways), and intiqālāt (modulation practices) within a unified digital framework.

## Overview

The Arabic Maqām Network represents a significant advancement in computational musicology, providing the first comprehensive platform for interactive maqām analysis and exploration. Developed by **Dr. Khyam Allami** and **Ibrahim El Khansa** at the **Music Intelligence Lab** at the **American University of Beirut**, this application employs a culturally specific approach that prioritizes Arabic theoretical frameworks and epistemological systems.

Unlike existing resources that focus primarily on educational approaches or automatic classification, our platform provides dynamic representation and user-centered exploration of maqāmic concepts. The system serves as both an analytical tool and a repository of ground truth data that supports creative, educational, and research applications.
