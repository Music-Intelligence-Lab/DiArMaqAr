- any changes to reference pitch (Hz) or string length seem to be making permanent changes in the tuningSystems.json - double check
- add tuning system ID to URL so that page can be refreshed without having to reselect tuning system. We will need to add the same for selected jins or maqam in the future as well.
- add option to sort tuning systems by creator (english) or year
- make octave 0 closed by default
- remove all stylisation from CSS to make things cleaner and more compact 
- change "Index" to "Pitch Class"
- Arabic note name dropdown menu only needs to be present for octave 1. For other octaves it can just display without dropdown. Also the dropdown needs to contain all names from Octave 1 and 2. For example, when starting a tuning system from 'ushayran, some note names from octave 2 are needed, and at the moment they are not displaying.
