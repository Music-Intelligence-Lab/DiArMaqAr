- Abjad is necessary for octave 1 and octave 2 but not for 0 or 3

17 Apr 2025
- Add ID and URL parameters for ajnas and maqamat
- Add URL parameter for starting note name yegƒÅh or 'ushayran. Currently if a jins is selected and then the starting note name is changed, everything resets. By adding this to the URL parameters it should work better
- Add cascade Abjad and apply disable cascade button
- Add play selected checkboxes sequence button (for now ascending and descending including the highest note repeated)
- Add different waveforms for audio playback 
- Make current selection plus ajnas and maqam analysis and transpositions into separate components that display in the same space
- Data of analysis and transpositions table should include following rows: AR note names, EN note names, pitch class input type values and intervals, cents values and intervals.
- Saving abjad in octave two not working - only octave one is saved
- Move clear selection button to somewhere else for easier access

 - problems with saving new ajnas: currently when I update ajnas or create a new one, the new ID numbers are all deleted and the note names of the new jins are not saved.
