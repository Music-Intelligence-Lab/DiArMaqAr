- Abjad is necessary for octave 1 and octave 2 but not for 0 or 3

- Add ID and URL parameters for ajnas and maqamat
- Add URL parameter for starting note name yeg훮h or 'ushayran. If jins selected and starting note name changed the jins selection doesn't update. By adding this to the URL parameters it should work
- Add cascade Abjad and apply disable cascade button
- Add play selected checkboxes sequence button (for now ascending and descending including the highest note repeated)
- Add different waveforms for audio playback 
- Make current selection plus ajnas and maqam analysis and transpositions into separate components that display in the same space
- Data of analysis and transpositions table should include following rows: AR note names, EN note names, pitch class input type values and intervals, cents values and intervals.
- Saving abjad in octave two not working - only octave one is saved
- Problem with the available ajnas in the jins manager list: Choose Al-Urmawi First Oud Tuning, select Ushayran as starting note name, jins bay훮t yeg훮h is clickable, even though the note name yeg훮h is not in the list.
