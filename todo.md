- When Octave is collapsed force showing pitch class and note name rows

- Default note naming convention should be based on Al-Kindi 12 tone system and naming convention

- Check why yegah starting note name always saves with tuning system even if the starting note name is changed before initial first time save 

- Maqam Analysis and Transpositions: Add row of which ajnas exist within teh currently selected maqam. Add a second row underneath with a play jins button and a highlight jins button which highlights the relevant cells in the table.

- Find a way to separate the accidental in the English Note Name so it can be used for other purposes. i.e. C# or Bb or B-- or G+

- Add staff notation to ajnas and maqamat based on English Note Names or Midi Note Numbers (without decimal) including transpositions using VexFLow: https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow which already includes "microtonal" accidentals using saggital (see "const accidentals" here: https://github.com/0xfe/vexflow/blob/master/src/tables.ts). For this we will need to be able to separate the accidental in the English note name so we can use it to access the correct accidental in vexflow.

- Bibliography: in my original note there was info about different fields needed for Type: Article, but those aren't implemented :(
  - Change names and 
    "Release Date" to "Publication Date"
    "Original Release Date" to "Original Publication Date"
    "Location" to "Place" 
    "Digitized" Book URL to URL

  - If Type: Article is selected 
  show input fields:
    Journal (EN/AR)
    Volume (EN/AR)
    Issue (EN/AR)
    Page Range (EN/AR)
    DOI (EN only - this is similar to ISBN)

  hide input fields:
    Publisher (EN/AR)
    Place (EN/AR)
    Publication Date (AR/EN) - Keep Original Publication Date
    ISBN
    
- Transpositions table: we need a way to differentiate which transpositions are from which octave. Ideally with colour/styling. Please add something to code and then we can play with some ideas.

- Add these synth types to our "waveform" select. All data is opensource we will just need to credit them somewhere:
https://github.com/xenharmonic-devs/scale-workshop/blob/main/src/synth.ts

- Patterns Input: add roman numerals with minus sign for lower octave and with plus sign for upper octaves i.e. VII-, I+

- Patterns Playback: There is currently a problem with the playback when it reaches the octave and starts descending. Before fixing it, we need to think in more detail about the logic of different patters and how they deal with the Root note and the Octave.

Currently the pattern playback only continues ascending until the last note of the pattern is the octave. Instead it should continue until the first note of the pattern is the octave (VIII), and then start its descent. When descending, it should end when the first note of the pattern reaches the Root (I). BUT this only works for patterns that START from the Root (I). This means we need to detect certain info about the pattern and then implement the behaviour of how to deal with reaching the octave accordingly.

- Please check Ajnas and Maqamat transposition row numbers, the sequence gets chopped i.e. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6

- For all the buttons that play a pattern, on click change the play symbol to a stop symbol and make the button stop the playback if clicked a second time

- Add extra weights to the fonts used in the site

- MIDI Inputs and Outputs not working
