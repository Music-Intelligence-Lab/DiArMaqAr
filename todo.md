- Add ID and URL parameters for ajnas and maqamat
- Add URL parameter for starting note name yegƒÅh or 'ushayran. Currently if a jins is selected and then the starting note name is changed, everything resets. By adding this to the URL parameters it should work better
- Add play selected checkboxes sequence button (for now ascending and descending including the highest note repeated)
- Data of analysis and transpositions table should include following rows: AR note names, EN note names, pitch class input type values and intervals, cents values and intervals.
