# Cultural Framework

DiArMaqAr operates through a culturally-specific methodology that prioritizes Arabic theoretical frameworks and epistemological systems. This approach reflects decolonial computing principles and challenges Anglo-European-centric paradigms in digital musicology.

## Decolonial Computing Principles

### Foundational Philosophy

As Serra (2011) identifies, there is a foundational epistemological problem in digital musicology: "Our information technologies do not respond to the world's multicultural reality; instead, we are imposing the paradigms of our market-driven western culture on IT."

**Postcolonial Computing Framework** (Irani et al. 2010):

* Digital technologies can either reinforce or challenge hierarchies of knowledge
* Scope must encompass software and hardware design
* Systems embed cultural assumptions into technical foundations
* Not just user interface choices, but architectural decisions

### DiArMaqAr's Approach

The platform implements culture-specific methodology by:

1. **Prioritizing Arabic Theoretical Frameworks**
   * All operations grounded in Arab-Ottoman-Persian note naming convention
   * Arabic concepts as foundational logic, not exotic variation

2. **System-Level Implementation**
   * Data model enforces Arabic structures
   * Computational operations built from Arabic theory
   * Interface presents Arabic hierarchies natively

3. **Avoiding Western-Centrism**
   * Arabic maqām theory is not a deviation from Western tuning
   * Represents independent theoretical frameworks
   * Avoids positioning as "alternative" or "xenharmonic"

## Arab-Ottoman-Persian Note Naming Convention

### Primary Reference System

All pitch calculations begin from this framework:

* **Note names**: rāst, dugāh, segāh, chahārgāh, nawā, etc.
* **Organizational hierarchies**: Tanāghīm → Ajnās → Maqāmāt → Suyūr → Intiqālāt
* **Four octaves**: Extended lower (qarār prefixes) and upper (jawāb prefixes) octaves

### Implementation

* **Data model**: Enforces Arabic note naming
* **Calculations**: Begin from Arabic frameworks
* **Interface**: Presents Arabic hierarchies natively
* **Operations**: Built directly from Arabic structures

## Avoiding Microtonality Terminology

### Critical Terminology Standards

**NEVER use "microtonal":**
This Western-centric term implies deviation from equal temperament as the norm.

**Use culturally appropriate alternatives:**

* "Unequal divisions"
* "Non-12-EDO pitches"
* "Pitches with fractional precision"
* "Pitches with decimal/fractional MIDI values"
* Describe specific theoretical framework (e.g., "following Arabic maqām theory")

**This applies to ALL:**

* Code comments
* Documentation
* Variable names
* Function descriptions
* Export data
* User-facing text

## Historical Authenticity

### Source-Based Implementation

* **Historical sources**: Medieval treatises through modern scholarship
* **Bibliographic attribution**: Complete source references
* **Scholarly verification**: Enables academic citation
* **Transparent provenance**: Clear data origin

### Avoiding Standardization Bias

As Marcus (1989) documents, 20th-century "modernisation" trend increasingly adopted Anglo-European frameworks to standardize historical diversity. DiArMaqAr:

* Preserves historical diversity
* Avoids forcing external frameworks
* Maintains multiple theoretical approaches
* Respects interpretative flexibility

## Computational Representation

### Culture-Specific Formalization

Following Serra (2017), DiArMaqAr approaches Arabic maqām as:

* "A system of interconnected entities"
* Musicians, instruments, performances, melodic motifs
* Linked through various relations
* Requiring "adequate digital traces, rigorous formalization"
* Grounded in culture-specific theoretical frameworks

### Integration of Perspectives

As Srinivasamurthy et al. (2023) demonstrate for Indian art music, computational musicology requires:

* "Integration of ethnomusicological perspectives alongside signal processing"
* Making explicit what remains implicit in Western-centric approaches
* Recognizing that every computational method carries embedded musicological assumptions

## Research Implications

### Infrastructure Gap

Addresses core structural problem identified by Gedik and Bozkurt (2009):

* Divergence between theory and practice
* Lack of reliable, computationally accessible theory
* Need for "valid pitch-class definitions grounded in culturally-specific frameworks"

### Model for Other Traditions

DiArMaqAr demonstrates:

* Viability of culture-specific approaches
* Preservation of cultural specificity
* Computational accessibility without cultural compromise
* Potential for broader digital humanities applications

## Practical Implementation

### Technical Architecture

* **Note naming**: Arab-Ottoman-Persian convention as primary
* **Data organization**: Arabic hierarchies enforced
* **Calculations**: Begin from Arabic frameworks
* **Interface**: Arabic concepts presented natively

### Bilingual Support

* **Library of Congress Romanization**: International scholarly standards
* **Arabic script**: Native language support
* **Reverse transliteration**: Accurate conversion
* **Cultural accessibility**: Local and international communities

## Challenges and Responses

### Avoiding Reductionism

* Maintains complexity of historical sources
* Preserves multiple theoretical perspectives
* Resists simplification to fit computational models
* Honors interpretative traditions

### Computational Precision vs. Cultural Authenticity

* Mathematical accuracy maintained
* Historical sources preserved
* Performance practice variations accommodated (cents tolerance)
* Balance between precision and authenticity

## Academic Context

### Scholarly Contribution

DiArMaqAr contributes to:

* Decolonial computing discourse
* Computational ethnomusicology
* Digital humanities methodology
* Culturally-responsive technology

### Model for Future Work

Provides framework for:

* Similar projects in other musical traditions
* Culture-specific digital musicology
* Preservation of local knowledge systems
* Global accessibility with cultural integrity
